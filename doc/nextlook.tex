\begin{abstract}
NeXtlook is a quicklook processor for generating range-time-intensity and range-Doppler plots of NeXtRAD datasets. Multithreading is supported for pulse-compression, but Doppler-processing is currently only supported when using a single thread.
\end{abstract}

\chapter{Installation}
\textit{This chapter documents the installation process for the NeXtlook processor. Additional dependencies are required when the editing of source code is required.}
\section{Prerequisites}
\subsection{FFTw}
Download the latest version of FFTw from their website ensuring that the version number is 3.3.6 or higher. This version introduced thread-safe planners which are vital. 
Extract the files in an arbitrary location and run the following commands,
\begin{lstlisting}
./configure --enable-threads
make -j
sudo make install
\end{lstlisting}
If any problems occur I suggest using the following command to perform a clean before retrying,
\begin{lstlisting}
make distclean
\end{lstlisting}
The extracted folder can now be deleted.
\subsection{Misc.}
\begin{lstlisting}
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install libopencv-dev
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
\end{lstlisting}

\section{NeXtlook}
At the time of writing, the NeXtlook source code is located at \url{https://github.com/darrynjordan/nextlook}. The source can be downloaded as a zip folder or cloned from the repo,
\begin{lstlisting}
git clone https://github.com/darrynjordan/nextlook.git
\end{lstlisting}
Within the cloned folder, create a new folder to hold the built executable and run Cmake,
\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
\end{lstlisting}
If no errors have occurred, the executable can be compiled and run as follows,
\begin{lstlisting}
make -j
./nextlook
\end{lstlisting}
